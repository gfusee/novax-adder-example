# Novax Adder Contract Interaction Example

This repository demonstrates how to use the "novax" library to deploy and interact with [the official example "adder" contract](https://github.com/multiversx/mx-sdk-rs/tree/master/contracts/examples/adder).

It includes deployment, endpoint call and view querying.
Obviously, the .pem used is not on this repo, make sure to use your own and provision it some EGLD.
